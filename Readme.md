# The Ass Synth

## A Jacob Hoffer Special

This project in my eyes is an astounding success that I may or may not continue to build upon. It is the skeleton of a project we already worked on in class except injected with steroids. There honestly are probably multiple mistakes within it but that's ok. There are also certain things that I didn't get around to doing. For the most part all the controls are pretty simple, they're all sliders so if you want more of a certain setting just turn it up. They probably could be lable and detailed better but oh well.

The first thing I tackled was actually getting the arpeggiator to work because the state I had it in was completely fucked. I got it though! It took almost an hour... I am quite happy with that neat little feature. It definitely was a pain in my ass though. :)

I then threw a bunch of effects at the synth starting with a reverb. It was pretty simple to get setup and I think I have it in the right place in the signal chain if I'm reading the signal flow correctly (which I think I am). The controls are extremely straight forward for that effect as well.

Next I made the majesty that is what I have dubbed "Fruity Dist" which is my custom distortion that technically works but is kind of fucked up. You can technically hear it affecting the signal however, I think it's either in a bad spot in the signal chain or it just comes down to the synthesizer because it is difficult to notice it's effect. I used the distortion effect and bitcrusher and connected them to the same slider that I labeled "mix" which is just how much of the affected signal you're getting. It's kind of a piece of shit but it works.
It was also originally supposed to have a button to engage it but that idea got thrown out the window because I couldn't remember how to set up a toggle like that off the top of my head and didn't want to relearn how to do it right now.

Finally there is a vibrato option and I only gave it one control labeled "vibrate". All it does is control the wet setting of the effect so if you turn it up you get more vibration. There were more settings I could have messed with but I didn't want to I just wanted to give the ability to add more or less vibrato.

There were some other ideas that I originally had planned like adding an option to change what instrument you're using and a step sequencer but they just didn't make the cut because I'm a big dumb stupid idiot and couldn't make them work immediately so I gave up. Anyways this is the Ass Synth enjoy! :]
